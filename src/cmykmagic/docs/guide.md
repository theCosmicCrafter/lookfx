# CMYK Magic: a visual guide

Every image on this page was made by running the node's own engine over one
source frame, changing one thing at a time. They go through the same
`resolve_settings` and `run_resolved` the node and its live preview use, so
nothing here can drift away from what you actually get.

Regenerate the whole set against your own image:

```bash

## Presets

Twelve of the 37. The important thing to understand is that a preset is not a
slider arrangement: it writes **every** setting at once, including the ink set,
the paper colour, the per-ink screen angles and the plate rendering mode. So
loading one and then reading the visible widgets tells you most of the story but
not all of it. Tick **Per-ink angle / freq** in the panel if you want the rest
of it on screen.

![presets](images/presets.jpg)

Picking a preset loads it and stays selected; touching any setting afterwards
flips the widget back to Custom, because what you have is no longer that preset.
Headless, a preset name in the widget just overrides everything directly.

## Patterns

Twelve of the 17 screens, all at the same scale so the only difference is the
pattern itself.

![patterns](images/patterns.jpg)

They fall into families. **Dot screens** (print dots, negative dots, elliptical
chain dot, square dots) are the classic halftone. **Hatching** (lines, broken
lines, cross lines, waves, broken waves, cross waves) replaces dots with
strokes; the wave variants are concentric contour flows, fingerprint-like,
rather than periodic wiggles, and the broken ones chop into stitch dashes that
merge back into continuous lines in the dark areas. **Radial** (fan dots,
negative fan, concentric rings, spiral) throws the lattice away from a centre
point. Then two odd ones out: **mezzotint** is stochastic grain with no lattice
at all, and **solid** turns the screen off entirely for flat ink fields, which
is the one to use when you need type to stay sharp.

## Why this reproduces the real process

Plenty of tools can put dots on an image. What makes this one read as genuinely
printed is that it models the separation, the screen angles and the tint calls
the way a press actually worked.

### One plate per ink

![plates](images/benday_plates.jpg)

The node's **second output** is the separation itself. Every ink gets its own
plate, screened at its own angle, exactly as it would go to press, and the
composite on the right is those plates stacked in print order. This is not a
colour filter applied to a finished picture, it is a real separation and
recombination, which is why overlaps behave the way ink does rather than the
way blend modes do.

### The angles are doing work

![rosette](images/benday_rosette.jpg)

Give every plate the same screen angle and the dots pile up on top of each
other into a coarse, blotchy moire. Offset them and the overlaps scatter into
the rosette that four-colour printing produces. That is the entire reason
presses standardised on angle sets, and it is the detail most halftone filters
skip.

The comic presets carry the real historical sets rather than generic offsets:
Y 75, M 45, C 105 for the Craftint era from the 1948 Yearbook, and Y 90, M 75,
C 105, K 45 for the Silver Age.

**Worth knowing:** an ink's own `angle` field is absolute and overrides
`offset_angles` completely. Most presets pin their angles this way, so if you
are turning the `offset_angles` dial on a preset and nothing is happening, that
is why. The sweep above uses the default ink set for exactly that reason.

### Four real printing eras

![eras](images/benday_eras.jpg)

Each of these is a preset carrying the screen angles, the tint calls and the
plate rendering that era actually used.

- **Craftint Golden Age** (1938 to 1955) prints 25 percent as dots, 50 percent
  as diagonal lines and 100 percent as solid, which is what the Craftint
  process offered.
- **DC Golden Age** is the same process with yellow tints left out entirely,
  as DC printed until 1969. That single omission drops the palette from 64
  colours to 32 and is why Golden Age DC flesh tones look flat and pale.
- **Silver Age** is the acetate method: no line tints at all, and the 50
  percent tint arrives as round negative dots, holes in ink, produced from the
  same screen at the same position.
- **Bronze Age 70s** screens every plate at one angle, because mid-70s
  engravers switched to a cheaper camera. No rosette, and visibly coarser
  colour as a result.

### Tint calls, not gradients

A colourist could not ask for 37 percent cyan. They called a tint from a fixed
set, which is why `tint_quantize` matters as much as the screen does. `25/50`
gives three calls per primary plus solid, and three primaries at four levels is
where the classic 64-colour comic palette comes from. The result is flat
stepped fields with no gradients anywhere, which is the single strongest tell
of the era.

## The sliders

### `scale`
Default **60**. Pattern size, and the first thing to reach for. 20 is fine
press, 350 is pop-art the size of your thumb.

![scale](images/scale.jpg)

### `roughness`
Default **20**. Distresses the screen from a clean press run to worn analog.

![roughness](images/roughness.jpg)

### `ink_multiply`
Default **60**. What happens where two inks overlap. At 0 the top ink is opaque
paint and hides what is under it; at 100 it is pure multiply and every overlap
darkens. Real ink sits in between, which is why the default does too.

![ink_multiply](images/ink_multiply.jpg)

### `dot_gain`
Default **35**. Ink spreads on absorbent paper, so a called tint prints heavier
than the film says. 0 is a calibrated press where a 20 percent call inks exactly
20 percent. 100 is newsprint letterpress, where that 20 percent grows to about
36, which is the historical comic figure.

![dot_gain](images/dot_gain.jpg)

### `ink_fade`
Default **10**. Worn, mottled ink density, as though the press was running low.

![ink_fade](images/ink_fade.jpg)

### `plate_drift`
Default **1.5**. Per-ink misregistration in pixels. The plates do not line up,
exactly like cheap colour printing, and a little of this is most of what makes
the look read as printed rather than filtered. Shown cropped, because a couple
of pixels of drift is invisible at page width.

![plate_drift](images/plate_drift.jpg)

### `contrast`
Default **0**. A pre-grade applied *before* separation, so it changes which inks
get called for rather than just adjusting the final picture. `brightness` works
the same way.

![contrast](images/contrast.jpg)

### `offset_angles`
Default **60**. The screen-angle step between successive inks. Real presses
offset their plates like this so the screens do not stack up into a moire, and
setting it to 0 shows you exactly why they bother.

![offset_angles](images/offset_angles.jpg)

### `rotate`
Default **0**. Rotates the whole screen set at once, keeping the relative angles
between the inks intact.

![rotate](images/rotate.jpg)

---

## `plate_render` and `tint_quantize`

These two are what separate a generic halftone filter from something that looks
like a comic actually printed in 1955.

### `plate_render`

![plate_render](images/plate_render.jpg)

`uniform` screens every plate the same way. `benday` makes each plate carry
several screens at once, the way a real Ben-Day plate did: light tints come out
as dots, deeper tints as a line or hatch sheet, and 100 percent as an unscreened
solid fill. Pair it with a tint quantize setting so the bands land on the
percentages a colourist could actually call for.

### `tint_quantize`

![tint_quantize](images/tint_quantize.jpg)

Snaps every plate to the tint percentages that were available to call for.
`25/50` is what both Craftint and the Silver Age acetate system offered: four
levels across three primaries, which is exactly where the classic 64-colour
comic palette comes from. `25/50/75` adds the call that arrived in the early
1980s. The result is flat stepped fields with no gradients, which is the single
biggest tell of the era.

## Randomisation

There are five separate ways to let the node surprise you, and they are all
driven by the **seed**. That matters more than it sounds: every random choice is
deterministic for a given seed, so a look you stumble into is never lost. Fix
the seed and it comes back exactly.

The usual way to work is to set the seed's `control_after_generate` to
**randomize**, let it roll until something is right, then set it back to
**fixed** to keep it.

### 1. Shuffle: a shortlist of presets

![shuffle](images/random_shuffle.jpg)

Click **🎲 Shuffle** in the presets section and the gallery switches from
"click to apply" to "click to select". Tick the presets you like, and one is
drawn from that shortlist on every run. **All** and **None** fill and empty the
list. Click Shuffle again to go back to applying presets normally.

The shortlist is sorted internally before the draw, so the result depends on
*which* presets are in it, not the order you happened to tick them. And the
shortlist is read before any preset is applied, so drawing a preset never wipes
out the list that chose it.

### 2. `pattern = random`

![random pattern](images/random_pattern.jpg)

The last entry in the pattern dropdown. Draws a fresh screen from the seed each
run. `solid` is deliberately excluded from the pool, because a flat ink field
turning up unannounced reads as a bug rather than variety.

### 3. Random per run: Inks, Paper, Ink pat.

![random inks](images/random_inks.jpg)

Three checkboxes under the palette swatches.

- **Inks** draws a whole ink set from the built-in palettes. Because it takes a
  real palette rather than arbitrary RGB, a rolled result is always
  print-plausible.
- **Paper** rolls the background. With **Inks** also ticked it takes the drawn
  palette's own paper colour, so the set stays coherent; on its own it picks
  from a list of paper tones.
- **Ink pat.** gives each ink its own screen, with roughly a 55 percent chance
  per ink of getting one rather than following the global pattern.

### 4. Per-ink dice

Each ink row has two small dice buttons, **c** and **p**, for colour and
pattern. These roll *only that ink*. Everything unmarked stays exactly where you
put it, which is the point: you can lock your yellow, magenta and black and roll
only the fourth ink, instead of re-rolling the whole set and losing the part you
liked.

### 5. Per-slider dice

Every slider has a dice icon beside it. Turn it on and that setting is rolled
inside a low/high range you set, on every run.

These are applied last, after any preset has been loaded, so a diced slider
overrides what the preset asked for. If you dice nothing, no draws are consumed
at all, which is what keeps a seed reproducing the same look after you add a
diced slider elsewhere.

The script needs ComfyUI importable, because the engine asks
`comfy.model_management` which device to use. It passes `--cpu`, so it will not
fight a running ComfyUI for the GPU. Point `--comfy` at your ComfyUI root if it
is not in the default place.
